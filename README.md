# FelineFinder - Cat Recognition System

FelineFinder is a Python-based image recognition system designed to identify whether an image contains a cat with up to 80% accuracy. What sets FelineFinder apart is its flexibility, as it can be easily customized to recognize other objects or animals by modifying the dataset.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: FelineFinder achieves an accuracy rate of up to 80% in distinguishing cats from other objects or scenes, making it a valuable tool for cat identification.

- **Customizable Datasets**: Easily adapt the system to recognize other objects or animals by customizing the dataset, making it versatile for various recognition tasks.

- **Deep Learning Technology**: FelineFinder utilizes cutting-edge deep learning algorithms to extract features and patterns from images, enabling continuous improvements in recognition accuracy.

- **Scalability**: FelineFinder's architecture is designed to handle larger and more diverse datasets, ensuring it can adapt to evolving recognition needs.

- **Real-World Applications**: Beyond cat lovers, FelineFinder finds use in wildlife monitoring, pet shelter management, and pet-centric mobile apps.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Access detailed installation guides, tutorials, and best practices for dataset customization to maximize the system's capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Add your desired dataset of cat and non-cat images to the `datasets` folder.

3. Place the image you want to compare in the `images` folder.

4. Open the Python script, replace the placeholder in the `my_image` section with the filename of the image you want to analyze.

5. Run the script to get the results. Remember that FelineFinder has an accuracy of up to 80%.


## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Object Recognition**: Expand the system's capabilities to recognize multiple objects or animals within the same image.

- **Real-Time Processing**: Implement real-time image recognition for applications like pet surveillance systems or mobile apps.

- **Cloud Integration**: Enable cloud-based recognition to handle large-scale image analysis projects.

- **User Feedback Integration**: Allow users to provide feedback on recognition results for continuous model refinement.
